# LLRS Executable Summary

The LLRS-exe is a simple system for running the LLRS. After the setup phase, the system will continuously poll the current segment pointed to by the AWG. To run the LLRS, the AWG must point to segment 1, then the LLRS will be executed. Following this, the AWG will point to segment 0 and the polling loop continues.
