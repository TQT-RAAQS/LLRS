# AWG
The Automatic Waveform Generator (AWG) is a versatile electronic instrument designed to produce various types of waveforms for use in a wide range of applications, such as signal testing, circuit testing, or trap manipulation and movement. 

In the context of the LLRS, the AWG is responsible for loading and streaming waveforms corresponding to the moves that are produced by the problem solving algorithms. 

The source code files and driver code for the AWG can be found [here](https://github.com/TQT-RAAQS/LLRS/tree/main/modules/awg).


The AWG performs concurrent loading and streaming of waveforms in order to minimize the time of execution for the LLRS.
