# Camera
An EMCCD (Electron Multiplying Charge-Coupled Device) camera is a type of digital camera specifically designed for low-light imaging applications where high sensitivity and high-speed imaging are required. It is particularly useful in scientific research, microscopy, astronomy, and fluorescence imaging where capturing faint signals is crucial. The LLRS uses an EMCCD to take pictures of the trap array in order to identify which traps have atoms present.

The model of EMCCD that is used by the LLRS is the Andor iXon Ultra 888.
