# Operating the LLRS

## Setup and Compile the LLRS ##
- Execute the command `meson setup bin` in the LLRS terminal
- Navigate into the bin directory using `cd bin`
- Execute `meson compile` in order to compile the LLRS

##  Configure and Setup the Experiment ##
There are several yaml files stored in the `configs` directory which allow for configuration of the AWG, EMCCD camera, and FGC hardware settings.
There is also a configuration file for the LLRS which allows the user to define the problem for the LLRS to execute. Note that this configuration file includes fields for a PSF file as well as csv files containing the alpha, nu, phi values of the AODs creating the trap array. These files must be generated by the user before the LLRS can run and must be stored in the resources directory at the appropriate subdirectory.
Note: The LLRS is setup to search the proper subdirectories for necessary support files. All resource files must be stored at the appropriate subdirectory, and only the file name must be provided in the field, not the full file path. 

## Run Experiment ##
Run the LLRS executable with the LLRS config file as the argument of the executable. This causes the LLRS to begin waiting for an AWG trigger which will start the experiment execution.
