# Movement Generator

The movement generator is a small module that can generate sequences of waveforms corresponding to movemenets along the traps using the AWG. This tool is designed to read experimental shots from a HDF5 file that is communicated via the ZMQ server, and is used to charaterize the probablity of atom loss.
