/*!
* \brief The ActiveBrowser library allows using the ActiveCapture feature browser in your own applications.
   The widget can display any number of GenApi nodemaps, each in their own tab.
   ActiveCapture being a Qt application the library provides a way to integrate the widget within an MFC 
   program.
   
   The ActiveBrowser Qt class is currently not exported, but will be in a later revision of the 
   library.

   MFC users
   *********
   ActiveCapture is developed using the Qt framework, which is not directly compatible with MFC. Therefore the
   library provides an API to use ActiveBrowser from an MFC application.
   The following Qt dependencies must be located in the application's directory. Those are installed with ActiveCapture,
   via the FireBird installer and you will need to ensure they can be found by your application; they are located
   in the installation directory next to the ActiveBrowser library:
   - Qt5Core.dll
   - Qt5Gui.dll
   - Qt5Widgets.dll
   - Qt5PrintSupport.dll
   - libGLESV2.dll
   - platforms
     - qwindows.dll
   - iconengines

   MFC dialog-based and MDI/SDI programs
   *************************************
   The library should be initialised differently depending on whether the MFC application is dialog-based or not.
   Dialog-based MFC programs should use ActiveBrowser_CreateQApp() and ActiveBrowser_DestroyQApp() whereas MDI/SDI
   MFC programs should use ActiveBrowser_MfcRun().

   Note about MFC's memory leak detection
   **************************************
   MFC contains a checkpoint-based memory leak detection mechanism. 
   This mechanism does not handle well Qt's system of allocating global static objects.
   The result is that when running applications that combine Qt and MFC (like the examples below) from within Visual Studio, 
   one will get a report about leaked objects upon application exit. These warnings can safely be ignored.

   Note about memory footprint
   ***************************
   The usage of icons in the ActiveBrowser, internally requires the creation of a QIconEngine. This, in turn, creates a static 
   instance of a QMimeDatabasePrivate. This instance being static, it persists even after ActiveBrowser_Destroy() has been called.
   This is normal and should not be considered a memory leak.
