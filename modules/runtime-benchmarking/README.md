# Runtime Benchmarking

The runtime benchmarking is a tool for measuring the runtime performance (timing) of the LLRS. It records the time taken for each step of the LLRS execution, and saves the data in a JSON file which then can be used to generate a LaTeX table with the results. This module can be accessed using the corresponding [Jupyter Notebook](../../tools/benchmarks/runtime-benchmarking.ipynb).
