# Waveform Streaming Benchmarking

The waveform streaming module contains two benchmark which are used to measure the runtime performance of the waveform uploading and the failure rate of the waveform streaming (hitting null segments in the data memory). The benchmarking module can be accessed using the corresponding [Jupyter Notebook](../../tools/benchmarks/wfm-streaming-characterization.ipynb).
