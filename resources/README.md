# Resources

This directory contains the many different types of files that support in the running of the LLRS.

The problems subdirectory contains the yaml files used to define problems for use of benchmarking. When using the operational-benchmarking configuration file, you can provide any yaml file from this subdirectory as the base_problem_definition to define the problem for operational benchmarking.
